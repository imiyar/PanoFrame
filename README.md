# PanoFrame

PanoFrame ([online demo](https://imiyar.github.io/PanoFrame/index.html)) is a platform that allows users to easily edit raw panoramic videos into a sequence of frames by adjusting viewing angles. People can take advantage of the video frames to tell their own stories and express their opinions about the space or events.

This repository contains the source code of the PanoFrame app.
